# React-Restaurant Template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a React Resteraunt Template with these features:

Home Page:

    Featured Food: a carousel with featured food items to be shown on front page with a modal onClick.

    Comments: a carousel with top 3 comments and modal display onClick.

    Leave a comment: form that posts to comment array to be shown on array modal.

    Google Maps: a simple google maps display at the footer of the site with marker placed at location address.

Menu Page: 

    Food Items Display component: Two custom display components for rendering through arrays holding "food items". One simple, one with 2 subsections.

    Food item display modal: custom display modal that has a order form selectors for ingredients, sides, options, and add ons.

    View order: Button section at bottom that has a modal holding entire current order.

    Order Total / Place Order: a button with total order price that will also place order. Placing order pops up modal with payment form. Submitting the form sends order through email and alerts customer of placed order.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
